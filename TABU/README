In this directory is c++ code that implements 
the algorithms to solve 
	Problem 4.1 Knapsack (optimization)
that are described in Sections:

	5.5.2   A tabu search algorithm

File name	contents/purpose

README		This message

defs.h          header file
setlib0.h       header file

setlib0.c       Library of elementary set operations.
tabu.c          Algorithm 5.26 

randks.c	Generates random instances of
		Problem 4.1 Knapsack (optimization).

  remark: Check the top of files for more details.

seed		File containing seed for the random
		number generator.

Sample		File containing sample data.

makefile	The makefile for compiling 
                the programs.

To compile the programs first check the makefile 
to see if it calls the c++ compiler on your machine 
with the right flags, etc.  Then type  "make all"
