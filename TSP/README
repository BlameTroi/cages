The files included are:



File name	contents/purpose

README		This message

defs.h		header file
setlib0.h	header file

setlib0.c	Library of elementary set operations.

tsp.c		Algorithms 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, and 4.23
		for solutions to the Traveling salesman problem.

	remark: Check the top of tsp.c for more detail.

rtsp.c		A an algorithm for generating random data for tsp.
seed		A file that contains a seed for the random number 
		generator.

sample		Sample data for tsp.

makefile	The makefile for compiling the programs.

To compile the programs first check the makefile to see if it 
calls the c++ compiler on your machine with the right flags, etc.
Then type  "make all"
