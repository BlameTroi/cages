  remark: Check the top of files for more details.

seed		File containing seed for the random
		number generator.

Sample		File containing sample data.

makefile	The makefile for compiling 
                the programs.

To compile the programs first check the makefile 
to see if it calls the c++ compiler on your machine 
with the right flags, etc.  Then type  "make all"
