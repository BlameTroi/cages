defs.h		header file
setlib0.h	header file

setlib0.c	Library of elementary set operations.

GA.c		Algorithm 5.26 a genetic algorithm for TSP

	remark: Check the top of GA.c for more detail.

makefile	The makefile for compiling the programs.

To compile the programs first check the makefile to see if it 
calls the c++ compiler on your machine with the right flags, etc.
Then type  "make all"
