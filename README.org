* Combinatorial Algorithms: Generation, Enumeration, and Search.

Source code for examples from _Combinatorial Algorithms: Generation, Enumeration, and Search_ by Kreher and Stinson.

This is an arcive copy of the code provided at Kreher's website for the C.A.G.E.S textbook [[https://pages.mtu.edu/~kreher/cages.html][here]]. The original files were provided as gzipped tar archives at: https://pages.mtu.edu/~kreher/cages/Src.html

There's nothing original here by me. I just figured posting the unarchived source might save some time for others. The original commit will be unaltered, but I will probably update the makefiles and source to work with clang on MacOS.
